- Code documentation: ChatGPT can be used to generate code documentation, such as comments and docstrings, which can help programmers and other team members understand the code better.

- Error messages: ChatGPT can be used to generate error messages that are more informative and easier for programmers to understand.

- Debugging: ChatGPT can be used to generate possible solutions for bugs and issues, which can speed up the debugging process.

- Language Model fine-tuning: Programmers can use pre-trained models like ChatGPT to fine-tune their model on the specific domain or task, which can help the model to understand the code and generate more accurate results.
